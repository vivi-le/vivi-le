👋 Hi, I’m Viviane LE. 

I am a highly experienced professional with a background in legal compliance. Currently, I am working as a data analyst in the banking industry at Banque Populaire du Nord. My main responsibility is to create and develop data-driven reports for the finance security department using Power BI and SQL. These reports help identify areas requiring corrective actions.
In addition to my expertise in data analysis, I also possess project management skills.
